# SPC Pocket Player

An [openFPGA](https://www.analogue.co/developer) core for the **Analogue Pocket**
that plays SNES/Super Famicom **.spc** music files on a real hardware
implementation of the S-SMP (SPC700) + S-DSP audio subsystem, extracted from
the [MiSTer SNES core](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/SNES_MiSTer) by srg320
(via [agg23's openFPGA port](https://github.com/agg23/openfpga-SNES)).

Nothing is emulated at the software level: the SPC700 CPU executes the music
driver from the .spc dump and the S-DSP renders the voices at the original
32 kHz, clocked at the authentic 21.47727 MHz master clock.

## Architecture

```
.spc file (SD card)
   │  APF bridge (data slot 0 @ 0x10000000)
   ▼
data_loader (CDC 74.25 MHz → 21.47727 MHz, 16-bit LE words)
   ▼
spc_apu.vhd ── loader FSM routes the file:
   ├─ header 0x25-0x2B ───────► SPC700 registers (PC/A/X/Y/PSW/SP) via IO port
   ├─ 64KB ARAM image ────────► dual-port BRAM (also captures $F0-$FF page)
   ├─ DSP regs @0x10100 ──────► DSP register file via IO port (0x100-0x17F)
   ├─ extra RAM @0x101C0 ─────► ARAM $FFC0-$FFFF
   └─ after load: replays $F0-$FF page → IO 0x2F0-0x2FE
      (SMP control/timers/DSP address latch), then releases APU reset
   ▼
SMP (SPC700) ◄──► DSP ◄──► ARAM BRAM ──► AUDIO_L/R @32kHz ──► sound_i2s (48kHz I2S)
```

Video output is full-screen 512×480 at 60.09 Hz (21.477 MHz dot clock,
10:9 to fill the Pocket display): track counter, ID666 song/game title,
8 per-voice envelope bars, and stereo VU meters.

## Albums (.spcpak)

The data slot is `deferload`: the core pulls one 0x10200-byte song at a time
with `target_dataslot_read`, so a single file can hold a whole soundtrack.

```sh
python3 tools/make_spcpak.py ~/spc/chrono-trigger/ -o "Chrono Trigger.spcpak"
```

A plain `.spc` is just a 1-song pack — both load the same way.

**Library packs**: pack your entire collection into one indexed file (one
album per folder) and never touch the file browser again:

```sh
./tools/pack_all.sh ~/spc /media/sd/Assets/spc/common --library
```

L1/R1 jump between albums; **Select** opens an on-screen album browser
(d-pad to scroll, left/right to scroll a long name, A to jump).

**Controls**:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad ◀ / ▶ | previous / next track |
| A | restart current track |
| Y | shuffle on/off (`S` indicator) |
| X | scope: whole pack / current album (`A` indicator) |
| L1 / R1 | previous / next album |
| Select | open/close the album browser (d-pad scroll, ◀▶ scroll long names, A jumps) |

Shuffle is contextual to the scope (whole pack, or within the current
album). Auto-advance uses ID666 length tags, with a 2-second fade-out; a
song that goes silent for 4 seconds also advances.

**Display**: track number, shuffle indicator, elapsed/total time (MM:SS),
song + game title, 8 per-voice envelope bars (one colored column per DSP
voice), and stereo VU strips.

**Fade-out**: tagged songs fade over their final 2 seconds before
advancing.

**Auto-advance**: the pack tool reads each song's ID666 length+fade tag
(or `--default-length`, 180s, when untagged; 0 = loop forever) and stamps it
into the entry; the core moves to the next track when the time is up. Plain
`.spc` files loaded directly loop forever.

**Status indicators**: a full border is shown only before the first song
plays (red = waiting for a file, orange = loading, magenta = read failed
after ~10 automatic retries). After that, a small square in the top-right
corner shows the same colors whenever playback is stopped; track changes
keep the normal UI on screen.

**File changes**: after picking a new file the core waits ~0.5s before
reading it (APF needs time to swap files), and the command channel has a
watchdog so a misbehaving transfer can never require a core reboot.

**Echo-buffer hygiene**: many SPC dumps carry garbage in the echo buffer
region, audible as a noise burst with an echo tail at song start. The
loader zeroes the echo region on every load (only when the song has echo
writes enabled, so repurposed RAM is never touched).

## Building

Requires Quartus Prime (Lite) with Cyclone V support.

```sh
./build.sh          # compile + bit-reverse + assemble SD tree in out/
```

Copy the contents of `out/` onto the Pocket's SD card root, then put your
`.spc`/`.spcpak` files in `/Assets/spc/common/`. Launch the "SPC Player"
core and pick a file.

## Simulation

The APU + loader are fully simulatable with GHDL (no license needed):

```sh
python3 tools/make_test_spc.py sim/test_tone.spc   # deterministic 1kHz tone
python3 tools/make_arp_spc.py  sim/test_arp.spc    # timers+ADSR+echo test
./sim/run_sim.sh test_tone.spc 100                 # renders 100ms of audio
python3 tools/raw_to_wav.py sim/work/audio_out.raw # convert + analyze
```

The testbench streams the real .spc file through the same loader interface
the Pocket uses and dumps every 32 kHz sample pair to `sim/work/audio_out.raw`.

## Changing files mid-session

You can pick a new `.spc`/`.spcpak` from the menu while the core is running
and it loads the new file — no relaunch needed. (This took some doing: it
only works because the data slot's `parameters` is `0x09` and specifically
does **not** set bit 8 "reload bitstream"; with that bit set the Pocket
silently refuses to read the re-picked file. The full story is in
[`docs/mid-session-reload-investigation.md`](docs/mid-session-reload-investigation.md).)

For a whole collection, a single indexed **library pack**
(`pack_all.sh <root> --library`) is still the nicest experience — pick it
once and browse albums with L1/R1 and Select, with shuffle and auto-advance
across everything.

## Limitations

- Extended ID666 (xid6) tags are ignored; play lengths come from the
  standard header tags (or `--default-length` at pack time).
- Audio is sample-and-held from the DSP's native 32kHz to the Pocket's
  48kHz I2S (same approach as the SNES core).
- The DSP register snapshot restores what the .spc format captures; voices
  keyed on at dump time restart from their sample beginnings (a format
  limitation shared by all SPC players).
- Packs created by tool versions before the index/length features still
  play, as a single album without auto-advance.
